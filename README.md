# Astro Project

Welcome to the Astro project!

This project was created using Astro, a modern static site generator.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/            # Images, icons, and other assets
